					<section>
						<h3>First part: Collect the data! </h3>
						<p>Let us go through example answer, which is also available on Moodle. </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Second part: Come up with a simple research quesiton and analyse it. </h3>
						<p class="fragment">Remember that for the exam you will have to write a similar report. </p>
						<ul class="fragment">
							<li>An open question and some data for you to work with. </li>
							<li>The report should include the following three elements: </li>
							<ol>
								<li>Description of a research design: How would you explore a specific research question? </li>
								<li>Reporting and interpretation of findings from some (simple) data analysis (of your choice). </li>
								<li>A <em>brief</em> discussion of strengths and weaknesses of your study design. (can be structured as bullet points)</li>
							</ol>
							<li>Justify your choices! </li>
							<li>Any use of methods from class will satisfy, but more advanced methods will recieve higher marks (if applied correctly). </li>
							<li><strong>The report should be <em>concise</em> and to the point!</strong> </li>
							<li>(long essay style discussions will not give you an advantage) </li>
							<li>You will not be marked on your writing skills, as long as the points you are making are clear. </li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Marking of written report </h3>

					<section>
						<h3>90 minutes closed book </h3>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">The exam will consist of two parts: </li>
							<ol>
								<li class="fragment">A number of concrete questions/tasks that needs to be answered in one or two paragraphs. </li>
								<li class="fragment">An open question that requires you to do some (simple) analysis with data provided and write a short report. </li>
							</ol>
							<li class="fragment">You can recieve a maximum of 20 points for each part (so 40 points in total)</li>
							<li class="fragment">And you need 21 points to pass. </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Exam submission </h3>
						<p class="fragment">Consists of two documents: </p>
						<ol>
							<li class="fragment">A written document: This is where you answer <em>all</em> the exam questions and write your report. </li>
							<li class="fragment">An R script (.R extension): This is where you document how you have got the results for your answers and written report. </li>
						</ol>

						<h3>Structure</h3>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Manage your time well. </li>
							<li class="fragment">90 minutes in total, 20 points for each part. </li>
							<li class="fragment">But maybe best idea to spend more time on the report. </li>
							<li class="fragment">A simple recommedation: 30min/60min. </li>
						</ul>
						<p class="fragment">This gives you "1,5min per point". </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">There will be 8-10 questions. </li>
							<li class="fragment">The exam sheet will state how many points you can get for each question (1,5-4). </li>
							<li class="fragment">So use this to consider how much time to spend on each quesiton. </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Exam question examples  </h3>
						<p class="fragment">There will be different types of questions: </p>
						<ol>
							<li class="fragment">Theoretical questions. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Change the code. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Interpret code output. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Methodological quesitons. </li>
						</ol>
						<p class="fragment">The quesitons can be about anything we have coverede in lectures, tutorials, or readings during the course. (see also slides from yesterday's lecture for an overview of <em>some</em> of the key concepts. </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Methodological question example: </h3>
						<p>There are two basic types of Machine Learning. Imagine you have a dataset, conssiting of tweets from different political campaign groups. You want to give each of these tweets a score on an ideological scale from very left-wing to very right-wing. Which type of Machine Learning would you use? </p>
						<p><em>(1,5 points)</em></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Theoretical question example: </h3>
						<p>Grimmer and Stewart (2013) describes four principles for computational text analysis. The first of these states that "All quantitative models of language are wrong - but some are useful."</p>
						<p>Give an example of how computational text analysis can be useful. </p>
						<p><em>(3 points)</em></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>"Change the code" question example: </h3>
						<p>The following piece of R code creates a document-feature-matrix from a corpus, stemming the words and removing punctuation: </p>
						<pre><code class ="r hljs" data-trim>
						text_dfm <- dfm(textCorp, stem = TRUE, remove_punct = TRUE)
						</code></pre>
						<p>Change the code so that all characters are made lower case in the document-feature-matrix. </p>
						<p><em>(1 point)</em></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>"Interpret code output" question example: </h3>
						<p>A dataset of all inaugural speeches by American presidents is used to compare Obama's speeches to all other presidents. A keyness test gives the following result:</p>
						<pre><code class ="r hljs" data-trim>
ObamaKeyn <- textstat_keyness(inaugDfm, c("2009-Obama", "2013-Obama"))
> head(ObamaKeyn)

						<p>Which of these most <em>key</em> words, are used the most by Obama? </p>
						<p><em>(1 point)</em></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Open question example: </h3>
						<p>Imagine a study where you need a measure the attitudes of different politicians toward public spending. Describe one advantage and one disadvantage of using social media posts from each politican to measure this? </p>
						<p><em>(3 points)</em></p>
