					<section>
						<cite style="font-size: small; font-style: italic;">Ali, M., Sapiezynski, P., Korolova, A., Mislove, A., & Rieke, A. (2019). Ad Delivery Algorithms: The Hidden Arbiters of Political Messaging. ArXiv:1912.04255 [Cs]. Retrieved from http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04255</cite>
							<h3 class="fragment">Study whether it is harder to reach users who (tend to) disagree with with a message on Facebook than users who agrees. </h3>
						<p class="fragment">Facebook provides various tools to target ads on their platform. But ads are then delivered to actual users based on an algortihm that takes price as well as "relevance" into consideration. </p>
						<p class="fragment">This algorithm is not public though, so this paper tests which users are most likely to be shown political ads from two different candidates. </p>
					</section>	
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Researchers run ads for Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders </li>
							<li class="fragment">They attempt to target these ads to users who are less likely to vote for these candidates. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Facebook reviews all ads (including the content they link to) before an ad is run. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Study shows that "Facebook's ad delivery algorithms effectively differentiate the price of reaching a user based on their inferred political alignment with the advertised content, inhibiting political campaigns' ability to reach voters with diverse political views." </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Ethics</h3>
						<p>We consider the following actors: </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Facebook - we avoid harming Facebook's business by following all their requirements for identifying ourselves and paying for the ads we're running</li>
							<li class="fragment">politicians and companies whose images we use in our ads - we do not misrepresent them or their messages; instead we use their own wording and slogans and we give them free ads and traffic (all our ads lead to authentic and official webpages of the people or products we advertise); we don't expose them to the risk of being accused of discrimination since none of our ads are explicitly discriminatory</li>
							<li class="fragment">people who see the ads - first, we don't waste their time by running misleading ads - when they click, they land on an appropriate webpage whose content corresponds to what's advertised. Second, we try to limit the outrage we cause - we select the least inflammatory political ads (though it's very difficult with Trump). </li>
							<li class="fragment">people who _don't_ see the ads - in terms of the previous paper, we only ran real life opportunity ads once we were sure we had all the right apparatus to measure the delivery and calculate skew so that we wouldn't cause too much of actual discrimination (not exposing women to lucrative job ads, etc)</li>
							<li class="fragment">democracy - as you pointed out, we picked politicians that had already spend millions of dollars in fb ads so our small contributions were unlikely to change anything. On top of that all ads are run in parallel for both political sides to further minimize any potential influence.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>The legal side </h3>
						<p class="fragment">That's on the ethical side of things. On the legal side of things, we learnt that the ads we're running are considered political donations. We were not allowed to use grant or gift money on political advertising. Instead, all the ads were paid for from personal pockets of the American co-authors (I can't contribute to political parties in the US either), and for each ad they had to file a separate form to the Federal Electoral Commission.</p>

					<section>
						<cite style="font-size: small; font-style: italic;">Bond, R. M., Fariss, C. J., Jones, J. J., Kramer, A. D. I., Marlow, C., Settle, J. E., & Fowler, J. H. (2012). A 61-million-person experiment in social influence and political mobilization. Nature, 489(7415), 295–298. https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11421</cite>
						<p classs="fragment">Expreimental research design. </p>
						<p class="fragment">Three randomly assigned groups: </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">A social message group (n=60.055.176)</li>
							<li class="fragment">An informational message group (n=611.044)</li>
							<li class="fragment">A control group (n=613.096)</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="fragment">Three dependent variables: </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Clicking on "I voted" button: Political self-expression. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Clicking on polling-place link: Information seeking. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Publicly avialbe voting records: Actual turn-out. </li>
						</ul>
						<p class="fragment">For the last DV only 6.3m users were included and it was analysed on a group level. </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Results: </h3>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Social message group 0,39% (P=0,02) more likely to vote than informational and control group. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Social message group 2,08% more likely to click "I voted" button than informational group. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Social message group 0,26% more likely to seek information about polling station than informational group. </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Also test another hypothesis about the effect of seeing a friend share that they voted. </p>
						<p class="fragment">Unit of analysis: Users who shared that they voted. </p>
						<p class="fragment">DV's the same, but measured for each of the friends of user who shared that they voted. </p> 
						<p class="fragment">IV: Strength of tie with friends (decile of user-friend interactions).  </p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Real-world effect (estimated) of the study </h3>
						<p class="fragment">340.000 additional votes in 2010 midterm election, which corresponds to 0,14% of voting age population. </p>
						<p class="fragment">Out of a general increase in turnout by 0,60% points from previous election (from 37,2% in 2006 to 37,8% in 2010) s</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Exercise I: Group work</h3>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Would the study be covered by the GDPR at all? Why? </li>
							<li class="fragment">Consider how you would design a study like this to live up to the 7 basic principles of the GDPR: </li>
							<ul class="fragment">
								<li>Lawful basis </li>
								<ul>
									<li>Consent </li>
									<li>Perfomance of contract </li>
									<li>To comply with legal obligation </li>
									<li>Protecting vital interests of individuals </li>
									<li>In the public interest </li>
									<li>"legitimate interest" </li>
								</ul>
								<li>Purpose limitation </li>
								<li>Data minimuzation </li>
								<li>Accuracy </li>
								<li>Storage limitation </li>
								<li>Integrity and confidentiality </li>
								<li>Accountability </li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Exercise II: Group work </h3>
						<p>In groups, consider one of the four ethical principles from the Belmont/Menlo report in regards to the 61mil study. Do you think they followed this principle? And if not, how can it be justified? </p>
						<ul class="fragment">
							<li>Respect for persons (consent) </li>
							<li>Beneficience (benefifts vs. risks) </li>
							<li>Justice (fair distribution of risks and benefits) </li>
							<li>Respect for law and public interest (compliance and transparency-based accountability) </li>
						</ul>
