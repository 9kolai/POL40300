						<p classs="fragment">Expreimental research design. </p>
						<p class="fragment">Three randomly assigned groups: </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">A social message group (n=60.055.176)</li>
							<li class="fragment">An informational message group (n=611.044)</li>

						</ul>
						<p class="fragment">For the last DV only 6.3m users were included and it was analysed on a group level. </p>

						<h3>Exercise II: Group work </h3>
						<p>In groups, consider one of the four ethical principles from the Belmont/Menlo report in regards to the 61mil study. Do you think they followed this principle? And if not, how can it be justified? </p>

					<section>

							<h3 class="fragment">Study whether it is harder to reach users who (tend to) disagree with with a message on Facebook than users who agrees. </h3>
						<p class="fragment">Facebook provides various tools to target ads on their platform. But ads are then delivered to actual users based on an algortihm that takes price as well as "relevance" into consideration. </p>
						<p class="fragment">This algorithm is not public though, so this paper tests which users are most likely to be shown political ads from two different candidates. </p>
					</section>	
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Researchers run ads for Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders </li>
							<li class="fragment">They attempt to target these ads to users who are less likely to vote for these candidates. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Facebook reviews all ads (including the content they link to) before an ad is run. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Study shows that "Facebook's ad delivery algorithms effectively differentiate the price of reaching a user based on their inferred political alignment with the advertised content, inhibiting political campaigns' ability to reach voters with diverse political views." </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Ethics</h3>
						<p>We consider the following actors: </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Facebook - we avoid harming Facebook's business by following all their requirements for identifying ourselves and paying for the ads we're running</li>
							<li class="fragment">politicians and companies whose images we use in our ads - we do not misrepresent them or their messages; instead we use their own wording and slogans and we give them free ads and traffic (all our ads lead to authentic and official webpages of the people or products we advertise); we don't expose them to the risk of being accused of discrimination since none of our ads are explicitly discriminatory</li>
							<li class="fragment">people who see the ads - first, we don't waste their time by running misleading ads - when they click, they land on an appropriate webpage whose content corresponds to what's advertised. Second, we try to limit the outrage we cause - we select the least inflammatory political ads (though it's very difficult with Trump). </li>
							<li class="fragment">people who _don't_ see the ads - in terms of the previous paper, we only ran real life opportunity ads once we were sure we had all the right apparatus to measure the delivery and calculate skew so that we wouldn't cause too much of actual discrimination (not exposing women to lucrative job ads, etc)</li>
							<li class="fragment">democracy - as you pointed out, we picked politicians that had already spend millions of dollars in fb ads so our small contributions were unlikely to change anything. On top of that all ads are run in parallel for both political sides to further minimize any potential influence.</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="fragment">That's on the ethical side of things. On the legal side of things, we learnt that the ads we're running are considered political donations. We were not allowed to use grant or gift money on political advertising. Instead, all the ads were paid for from personal pockets of the American co-authors (I can't contribute to political parties in the US either), and for each ad they had to file a separate form to the Federal Electoral Commission.</p>

						<p class="fragment">So essentially we need to find all the unique combinations of values in our dataset and calculate how many times each of these combinations occur. </p>
						<p class="fragment">The uniqe combination of all answers that occurs the least times are then our k-anonymity. </p>

						<h3>Example</h3>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Hypothesis: CDU voters tend to be older than SPD voters - mean age of CDU voters > mean age of SPD voters.  </li>
							<li class="fragment">Null hypothesis: mean age of CDU voters = mean age of SPD voters </li>
							<li class="fragment">If we ask a <em>random</em> sample of voters about their age and what they voted, we can calculate the mean ages of each group. This is our estimate. </li>
							<li class="fragment">And then we can calculate how likely we are to get this result, if in fact the mean age of the two groups are the same for the whole population. This is the p-value. </li>
							<li class="fragment">So if the p-value is less than 0,05 it means that it is less than 5% likely to get our result by taking a random sample of respondents from a population where the mean age of the two groups are actually the same. </li>
